## Overview

## Static Website

### Gatsby.js

## Dynamic Website

### Client-Side-Rendering (CSR)

### Server-Side-Rendering (SSR)

## Content Management System (CMS)

### Prismic

[Primsic.io](https://prismic.io) come with a very generous free-tier and webhook integrations with minimal setup. The free-tier also hosted on prismic server with SSL enabled. It's super good for a blogging platform or just a simple company profile that want to have some updated content capabilities.

### Contentful

### Strapi

### Wordpress

Wordpress 5.0 built with RESTful API out of the box that can be consumed by any kind of website and mobile app. When it comes to building an online shop, wordpress really shines because it's plugins.

## Deployment

### Production deployment

### Development deployment

Sometimes you just need to deploy the website that you are building so the client can access it and give some feedback. For this purpose, we have few alternatives other than deploying to the shared hosting or production server.
