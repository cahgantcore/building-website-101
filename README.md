### Prismic

[Primsic.io](https://prismic.io) come with a very generous free-tier and webhook integrations with minimal setup. The free-tier also hosted on prismic server with SSL enabled. It's super good for a blogging platform or just a simple company profile that want to have some updated content capabilities.

### Contentful

### Wordpress

Wordpress 5.0 built with RESTful API out of the box that can be consumed by any kind of website and mobile app. When it comes to building an online shop, wordpress really shines because it's plugins.
